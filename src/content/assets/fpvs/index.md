# Novabeast - FPV Snoot & Global Collider

Add a first person view of your snoot and use it to interact with others' physbones!

## Features

- Judge where your snoot is by adding ghostly nostrils to your view
- Adjust the color via radial menu to adapt to various lighting conditions
- Use your snoot to nuzzle others' physbones via [global collider](https://vrcfury.com/components/global-collider/)
- Install the prefab easily for [Kittomatic's Novabeast](https://jinxxy.com/kittomatic/novabeast) using [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/)
- Pick between [lilToon shader](https://github.com/lilxyzw/lilToon), [Poiyomi shader](https://www.poiyomi.com/), or collider only

## How To Use

1. Add [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/) to your project using the [VRChat Creator Companion](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/)
1. Drag and drop "fpvs-v1.0.1.unitypackage" into your project panel
1. Drag and drop one of the prefab options under "Mass/FPV Snoot/Prefabs" onto your avatar in the heirarchy panel
1. If the visibility radial slider does not work properly, you may need to add the prefab to the exclusions in [d4rkAvatarOptimizer](https://github.com/d4rkc0d3r/d4rkAvatarOptimizer) if you are using it
