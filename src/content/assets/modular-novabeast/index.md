# Modular Novabeast - VRCFury

Modular version of the [Kittomatic's Novabeast](https://jinxxy.com/kittomatic/novabeast) using VRCFury components for easy optimization

- Don't want the goggles, collar, or hair? Delete the corresponding mesh and the physbones will be removed with it
- Have too many options cluttering your action menu? Get rid of menu items by deleting the relevant object from the hierarchy
- Femme and masc body meshes have been separated, saving ~1k tris

Caveats:

- Clothing assets may need extra work to install (e.g. adjusting blendshapes manually)
- The femme prefab comes in two options, with or without floof, due to interaction with the collar
