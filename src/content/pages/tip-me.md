## What is this website?

This is a custom website made by me, Maserooni! It was built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Why not use Gumroad or Jinxxy?

Feel free to use my [Jinxxy store page](https://jinxxy.com/mass/products) if that is more your speed!

Keep in mind that I have voluntarily set up my store to have a [10% platform fee](https://support.jinxxy.com/hc/en-us/articles/16736566037389) to help support their service.

**If you'd like to avoid those platform fees,** this website is the place for that! By integrating directly with a payment processor, your dollar is able to go as far as it possibly can.

## Is this website secure?

Yes, this website is served through HTTPS and all communications are secure.

All payment information is handled entirely through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), a payment processor trusted by Google, Amazon, Spotify, BMW, Airbnb, and millions of other companies.
