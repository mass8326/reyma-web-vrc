## Why not use Gumroad or Jinxxy?

[Third party marketplaces](https://gumroad.com/pricing) usually take a cut of every sale, including tips and donations.

Since my assets are free and every "sale" is from your kindness and generosity, I wanted show my thanks by making sure your dollar goes as far as it can.

Yes, this website is served through HTTPS and all communications are secure.

All payment information is handled entirely through [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), a payment processor trusted by Google, Amazon, Spotify, BMW, Airbnb, and millions of other companies.
